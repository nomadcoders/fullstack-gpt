       "AIMessage(content='Victory Mansions is a building where Winston Smith resides. It is described as having glass doors at the entrance, which allow gritty dust to enter along with people. The hallway of Victory Mansions has a smell of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. On one end of the hallway, there is a large colored poster depicting the face of a man in his forties with a black mustache. The building has seven floors, and the flat where Winston lives is on the seventh floor. The flat is accessed by stairs since the lift is rarely working. The building is not well-maintained, with rotting houses and patched windows. From the roof of Victory Mansions, one can see the other three buildings that house the Ministries of Truth, Peace, and Plenty.')"
